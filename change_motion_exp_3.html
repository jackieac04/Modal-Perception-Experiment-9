    <h3>CONSENT FOR RESEARCH PARTICIPATION</h2>
    <p>
      You are invited to take part in a Brown University
      research study. Your participation is voluntary.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        RESEARCHER: Roman Feiman, PhD, roman_feiman@brown.edu, 190 Thayer St, Providence, RI 02912
      </li>
      <li>
        PURPOSE: The study is about how people understand language. We are interested in what adult behavior is like so we can find out how language comprehension and production change as a person develops.
      </li>
      <li>
        PROCEDURES: You will be presented with images or text on a screen and asked to respond to them as quickly as possible. You will be asked to respond using the mouse or keyboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        TIME INVOLVED: The study will take approximately 30-45 minutes of your
        time.
      </li>
      <li>
        COMPENSATION: The amount of compensation you will receive depends on the criterion and the length of the study, in keeping with the averages and standards used in the Prolific community. 
      </li>
      <li>
        RISKS: There is no known or anticipated risk associated with your participation in this study. You may discontinue this study at any time.
      </li>
      <li>
        BENEFITS: You may not directly benefit from being in this research study.
      </li>
      <li>
        CONFIDENTIALITY: Information gathered in these studies will remain strictly confidential and published reports will not mention individuals by name.  If shared, data will be identified solely by anonymized numerical codes.

        Because participants are recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk website or on Testable, participation happens over the internet and we have no information about participantsâ€™ identities. We collect Worker ID numbers through Amazon Mechanical Turk. These will be stored electronically on password-protected computers, to which only authorized researchers will have access. Following standard practice, we will record IP address to check whether a particular internet connection is being used an unreasonable number of times for the same experiment. This information will only be used to exclude multiple datasets generated from the same IP address.
        
        Brown University staff sometimes review studies like this one to make sure they are being done safely and correctly. If a review of this study takes place, your records may be examined. The reviewers will protect your confidentiality.

      <li>
        VOLUNTARY: You do not have to be in this study if you do not want to be. Even if you decide to be in this study, you can change your mind and stop at any time.

    <h1 id="title">Object Experiment</h1>
        <h2>Welcome! Thank you for participating in our study.</h2>
        <p><u>Important,</u> before you begin: </p>
        <p>Please do this experiment on a <b>laptop</b> or <b>desktop computer</b>.
            If you are viewing this experiment on a phone or a tablet, please close the window and
            return later with non-mobile device.</p>
        <p> Second: <b>please maximize the window before you continue.</b>
        </p>
        <p> Click 'continue' once you have maximized the window and are ready
            to move on.
        </p>
        <button id="continueInstructionButton1">continue</button>
</span>

<div class="instruction" id="Instruction2">
  <p>In this experiment, every animation will present two disks to the left and right of a centrally located rectangle (screen) and two disks will be shown under the screen. During "preview," two shapes will
      appear: one on each of the disks on the sides. After 1.2 seconds, the shapes will disappear and the disks will move behind the screen. The screen will then disappear.
      After a moment, two shapes will be visible either on the disks that are under the screen or on the original disks.
  </p>
  <p>If the shapes are the same as in the preview, press 1 to indicate they are the same.
      If at least one of the shapes is replaced by a new shape, press 2 to indicate there is a new shape.
      It does not matter if the shapes reappear on the original disks. The only thing that matters 
      is that the two shapes on the disks at the end of the animation are the same as the shapes at the beginning of the animation.
      In short, you should base your decision solely on whether the preview shapes are the same as the final shapes.
  </p>
  <p>Click 'Practice' so you can try it!</p>
  <button id="startTrainingButton">Practice</button>
</div>

<div class="instruction" id="InstructionPractice">
  <p>When the shapes reappear:</p>
  <p>Press 1 if the shapes are the same at the end and the beginning of the trial.</p>
  <p>Press 2 if one of the shapes at the end of the trial is different.</p>
  <p>Do this as quickly as possible, while remaining accurate!</p>
</div>

<div class="instruction" id="Instruction3">
    <p>The practice is now complete. The experiment is about to start. The experiment will take
        around 40 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>Click 'Start' when you are ready. Remember, press 1 or 2 on
        the keyboard as fast as possible to indicate that the two shapes are the same as
        you saw before the disks moved (1), or there is a new shape (2).
