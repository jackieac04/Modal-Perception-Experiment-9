    <h3>CONSENT FOR RESEARCH PARTICIPATION</h2>
    <p>
      You are invited to take part in a Brown University
      research study. Your participation is voluntary.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        RESEARCHER: Roman Feiman, PhD, roman_feiman@brown.edu, 190 Thayer St, Providence, RI 02912
      </li>
      <li>
        PURPOSE: The study is about how people understand language. We are interested in what adult behavior is like so we can find out how language comprehension and production change as a person develops.
      </li>
      <li>
        PROCEDURES: You will be presented with images or text on a screen and asked to respond to them as quickly as possible. You will be asked to respond using the mouse or keyboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        TIME INVOLVED: The study will take approximately 30-45 minutes of your
        time.
      </li>
      <li>
        COMPENSATION: The amount of compensation you will receive depends on the criterion and the length of the study, in keeping with the averages and standards used in the Prolific community. 
      </li>
      <li>
        RISKS: There is no known or anticipated risk associated with your participation in this study. You may discontinue this study at any time.
      </li>
      <li>
        BENEFITS: You may not directly benefit from being in this research study.
      </li>
      <li>
        CONFIDENTIALITY: Information gathered in these studies will remain strictly confidential and published reports will not mention individuals by name.  If shared, data will be identified solely by anonymized numerical codes.

        Because participants are recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk website or on Testable, participation happens over the internet and we have no information about participantsâ€™ identities. We collect Worker ID numbers through Amazon Mechanical Turk. These will be stored electronically on password-protected computers, to which only authorized researchers will have access. Following standard practice, we will record IP address to check whether a particular internet connection is being used an unreasonable number of times for the same experiment. This information will only be used to exclude multiple datasets generated from the same IP address.
        
        Brown University staff sometimes review studies like this one to make sure they are being done safely and correctly. If a review of this study takes place, your records may be examined. The reviewers will protect your confidentiality.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        VOLUNTARY: You do not have to be in this study if you do not want to be. Even if you decide to be in this study, you can change your mind and stop at any time.

    <h1 id="title">Object Experiment</h1>
        <h2>Welcome! Thank you for participating in our study.</h2>
        <p><u>Important,</u> before you begin: </p>
        <p>Please do this experiment on a <b>laptop</b> or <b>desktop computer</b>.
            If you are viewing this experiment on a phone or a tablet, please close the window and
            return later with non-mobile device.</p>
        <p> Second: <b>please maximize the window before you continue.</b>
        </p>
        <p> Click 'continue' once you have maximized the window and are ready
            to move on.
        </p>
        <button id="continueInstructionButton1">continue</button>
</span>

<div class="instruction" id="Instruction2">
  <p>In this experiment, every animation will present one disk to the left of either one or two centrally located rectangles (occluders). During "preview," one shape will
      appear on the disk. After 1.2 seconds, the shape will disappear and the disk will move behind the occluder(s). If there are two occluders, it will clearly move behind one of them, however if there is just one occluder, the disk will move ambiguously behind the middle of the occluder.
      If there is just one occluder, it will split into two occluders. Both occluders will then move off-screen revealing the location of the disk. The disk will either be in the location you expect it, or it will appear in the opposite location you expect.
      After a moment, a shape will be visible on the disk. This shape may be the same or different than the original shape displayed in the preview.
  </p>
  <p>If the shape is the same as in the preview, press 1 to indicate they are the same.
      If the shape is replaced by a new shape, press 2 to indicate there is a new shape.
      It does not matter if the disks reappear in the original locations. The only thing that matters 
      is that the shape on the disk at the end of the animation is the same as the shape at the beginning of the animation.
      In short, you should base your decision solely on whether the preview shape is the same as the final shape.
  </p>
  <p>Click 'Practice' so you can try it!</p>
  <button id="startTrainingButton">Practice</button>
</div>

<div class="instruction" id="InstructionPractice">
  <p>When the shapes reappear:</p>
  <p>Press 1 if the shape is the same at the end and the beginning of the trial.</p>
  <p>Press 2 if the shape at the end of the trial is different.</p>
  <p>Do this as quickly as possible, while remaining accurate!</p>
</div>

<div class="instruction" id="Instruction3">
    <p>The practice is now complete. The experiment is about to start. The experiment will take
        around 40 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>Click 'Start' when you are ready. Remember, press 1 or 2 on
        the keyboard as fast as possible to indicate that the shape is the same as
        you saw before the disk moved (1), or there is a new shape (2).
